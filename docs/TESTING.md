# Testing Irwin

Run commands from the repository root after completing the development setup in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Tests use disposable MongoDB instances and isolated application profiles. Do not substitute real database URIs, credentials, or your normal application data directory.

## Automated regression suite

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Vitest runs `tests/**/*.test.ts`, including database integration, BSON and CSV round trips, JSON/JSONL parsing after desktop compilation, read-only enforcement, AI context redaction and output validation, connection safety, application state, and release tooling. MongoDB 8.0.18 test binaries are downloaded into the ignored `.runtime/mongodb/` cache when needed. Network access is required for the first download.

The certificates and private key in `tests/fixtures/` are intentionally public, localhost-only test fixtures. `scripts/create-test-certificates.py` regenerates them using Python's `cryptography` package; do not use them for any real service.

## Electron scenarios

Build first with `pnpm build`, then run the scenario relevant to your change on a native desktop with a graphical session. These are standalone Playwright Electron scripts, separate from `pnpm test`; run them sequentially to avoid clipboard and window-focus interference.

The Windows packaging workflow runs the desktop scenario against its unpacked candidate using `WORKBENCH_EXECUTABLE`. For local source checks, leave that variable unset. Reports and screenshots are written only to ignored `.runtime/` storage. A nonzero exit indicates a failed scenario; review any `unverified` entries before recording acceptance, especially when the native clipboard is unavailable.

These scenarios do not validate every cloud service, AI provider, operating system, or installation path. Complete [native release acceptance](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) using the exact installer to be distributed.

## Update workflow regression

`pnpm test` covers update discovery, single-click download/install, duplicate
clicks, cached/deferred installation, failed feeds/downloads, restart handshakes,
renderer input locking, platform eligibility, and release metadata integrity.

`node tests/e2e/updates.mjs` exercises the actual update dialog in a headless
Chromium component harness. Install Playwright's Chromium or set `CHROMIUM_PATH`
to an existing Chromium executable. It checks the in-app primary action,
progress, deferred restart, keyboard/input lock and retry; screenshots remain in
`.runtime/updates-ui/`. It never invokes a real installer and is not a native
Windows/Linux/macOS update acceptance test.

A ready update restarts automatically only when the update dialog is still open,
workspace tabs and other editors/dialogs are closed, and background requests/jobs
are idle. Otherwise it remains downloaded until the user saves/closes work and
explicitly chooses restart. Closing the update dialog during download defers the
restart. Exercise both paths in native acceptance with two different versions.
See [the updater release contract](AUTO_UPDATES.md) for signing and bootstrap.

## Optional transfer benchmark

`tests/performance/transfers.mjs` measures large transfers and UI responsiveness, then verifies document counts and a complete BSON digest after import. It uses its own MongoDB instance and application data directory. It is outside normal CI because its default one-million-document dataset produces a file larger than 5 GB and can take substantial time and disk space.

For a smaller local run, set `BENCHMARK_DOCS` explicitly. In PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:BENCHMARK_DOCS = '1000'
node tests/performance/transfers.mjs
Remove-Item Env:BENCHMARK_DOCS
```

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
BENCHMARK_DOCS=1000 node tests/performance/transfers.mjs
```

Results and datasets remain in `.runtime/benchmark-*/`. Keep them local; publish only deliberately reviewed, sanitized measurements when they explain a product change.
